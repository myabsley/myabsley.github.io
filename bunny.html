This little rabbit has been with me through thick & thin. What started as a joke at the Halifax airport when we placed the bunny on the miniature buildings resulted in me photographing my bunny wherever I travel in the world.  Bunny makes apperances at major world landmarks and I can't wait to take him to more.
